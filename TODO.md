# TODO List for AI Background Animation Enhancement

## Current Task: Add AI-related background images with animations to "Welcome to 4sight AI" hero section

### Steps to Complete:
- [x] Add AI background image elements to hero slide in index.html
- [x] Create CSS animations for floating/parallax effects in slides.css
- [x] Ensure images are subtle and don't interfere with text readability
- [x] Enhance background motion with more dynamic keyframes
- [x] Update images to AI-related visuals without human elements
- [ ] Test animation performance on live webpage (Cannot test - browser tool disabled)
- [x] Verify mobile responsiveness and text contrast (Verified via code review)

### Files to Edit:
- webpage/index.html: Add image elements to hero slide
- webpage/css/slides.css: Add CSS for image positioning, sizing, and animations

### Notes:
- Use multiple layered images with different animation speeds for depth
- Images should be AI-related (neural networks, circuits, AI icons)
- Maintain current gradient background and existing AI elements
